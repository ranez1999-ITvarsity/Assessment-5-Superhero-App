           <h4><b>Bio </b></h4>
           <p>Born as the half-Asgardian, half-Elder God son of Odin, the All-Father and King of Asgard, and as the Norse God of Thunder, Thor was an adventurous yet ill-tempered deity, often travelling to other realms to do battle with Asgardâ€™s foes. He spent much of his time in Midgard in particular, or our Earth, fighting as the mythic Germanic hero Siegfried and battling the ancient mutant, Apocalypse. As he became more arrogant, it became apparent to Odin that his son needed to learn the value of humility. To do so, he stripped Thor of his powers and memories, rendering him human and stranding him on Earth</p>
